# Comprehensive Movie Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a movie dataset to explore relationships between budget, gross earnings, and ratings. The analysis includes correlation studies, visualizations, and identification of key trends and top-performing companies.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Initial inspection, handling missing values, and outlier detection.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculation and visualization of correlations using Pearson, Kendall, and Spearman methods.
- **Data Visualization:** Scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to illustrate data trends.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Identification of top-performing companies based on gross revenue.
- **Tools Used:** Python libraries including Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
